			<h1>My first computer build</h1>
			<p>
				I never thought Iâ€™d build a computer, but then I found out the youtube was more then 
				just a place were you can go to watch funny videos or waste time. I found out you 
				could look up useful instruction on how to build and repair things around your house.
				Then I stumbled upon a video showing how you can build a computer. I thought to my self 
				wow this could be really cool so I clicked on it. After watching it a couple of times
				I found my local computer supply store and begain looking up parts for my computer build
				after I looked up all of the parts I then picked out the parts I looked up and made the trip back home
 				one hour later I got home and took the boxes of parts in side. Quickly I opened up all the parts and got to 
 				work. First I put the case on the table I grabed a screw dirver and my anti static band and installed the 
 				mouther bord I then installed the power supply unit and hooked all the nesacary connectors to. The mouther bord
 				next was the hard drive and the DVD burner all they had to do was get installed with only four screws. After that
 				I went ahead and installed my Ram and my processor. Now it was time for the heat sink and fan that only took a 
 				few seconds as my computer was almost done I was getting more and more excited. Then the final step 
 				was to hook up the cables form the case to the mouther bord after that was done I turnit it on and installed
 				my operating system.
