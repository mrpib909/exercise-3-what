			<h1>My first computer build</h1>
			<p>
			I never thought Iâ€™d build a computer, but then I found out that youtube was more then 
				just a place were you can go to watch funny videos or waste time. I found out you 
				could look up useful instructions on how to build and repair things around your house.
				Then I stumbled upon a video showing how you can build a computer. I thought to my self 
				wow this could be really cool so I clicked on it. After watching the video a couple of times
				I found out that my local computer supply store had the proper parts to fully build a computer so I  began looking up parts to build my computer
				after I looked up all of the necessary parts. I then paid for the parts I looked up and made the trip back home
 				one hour later I got home and took the parts inside. I then quickly  opened up all the parts and got to 
 				work. First I put the case on the table then I grabbed a screw driver and my anti static band and installed the 
 				mouther board then I installed the power supply unit and hooked all the necessary connectors to. The mouther board
 				next was the hard drive and the DVD burner all they had to do was get installed with only four screws. After that
 				I went ahead and installed my Ram and my processor. Now it was time for the heat sink and fan that only took a 
 				few seconds as my computer was almost done I was getting more and more excited. Then the final step 
 				was to hook up the cables form the case to the mouther board after that was done I turn it  on and installed
 				my operating system.
